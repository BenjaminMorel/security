After some research, I found that `.ows` files are used with scatter plots. I downloaded the `orange data mining` software which is an Open source machine learning and data visualization tool (https://orangedatamining.com/).

I opened the file and used the `.csv` file as an input

Then I linked the file with a scatter plot

Open the scatter plot and see the result!
